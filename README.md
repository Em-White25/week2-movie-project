## 📌 Introduction

This project is based on movie data retrieved from TMDB's API. The primary goal was to analyze key performance indicators (KPIs) and extract insights on how movies performed at the box office.

By transforming raw JSON data into a structured format, we explored various dimensions such as revenue, budgets, profits, and return on investment (ROI) to understand what makes a movie financially successful.

## 🛠️ Methodology

The project followed a step-by-step data analysis pipeline that included:

- **Data extraction** from TMDB’s API
- **Cleaning and transforming** raw JSON data
- **KPI computation** and deriving insights
- **Data visualization** for storytelling

### 🔧 Tools Used:
- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Git & GitHub  

### 📦 Libraries Used:
- `pandas`  
- `ast`  
- `requests`  
- `matplotlib`  
- `os`

---

### 📥 STEP 1: API Data Extraction

TMDB returns data in JSON format with nested structures. Using the `requests` library, movie data was fetched using a list of IDs. Data was saved to CSV format after light validation and inspection.

---

### 🧹 STEP 2: Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

The raw dataset required multiple transformations:
- Dropped irrelevant columns
- Parsed stringified JSON objects (e.g., cast, crew, genres)
- Extracted key details for analysis such as director names, genre tags, and actor lists

### 🔍 More Insights on Franchises vs. Standalone Movies

#### 🎥 Franchise vs Standalone: Budget & Revenue

Franchise movies dominate both in terms of production budget and total box office revenue.

![Franchise vs Standalone Budgets](images/franchise_vs_standalone_budget.png)

- **Franchises** such as *Avengers*, *Avatar*, and *Jurassic World* consistently had the highest budgets.
- These films benefit from existing audiences and perform well at the box office.

#### 💰 Budget vs ROI: Does Spending More Pay Off?

High budgets don’t always mean high returns.

![ROI Comparison](images/roi_comparison.png)

- *Avengers: Age of Ultron* had a massive budget (~$365M) but a relatively lower ROI (~3x).
- *Avatar* and *Titanic* stood out with ROIs over **10x**, showing cost-efficiency and widespread appeal.

---

### 📈 Budget vs Revenue Correlation

This scatter plot illustrates the relationship between movie budgets and their generated revenue.

![Budget vs Revenue](images/budget_vs_revenue.png)

- There is a **positive correlation** between budget and revenue, but with **notable outliers**.
- Some lower-budget films performed surprisingly well.

---

### 🔑 Key Takeaways:
- **Franchises** tend to bring big budgets and big returns, but not always proportinate ROIs.
- Does high budget guarantee a successful movie? **High budget ≠ high ROI**. Success depends on cost efficiency and strategic storytelling. Titanic and Avatar prove this.
- **Standalone films**, though riskier, can outperform when creatively executed, with effective stories and direction.

These findings highlight how data analysis can provide strategic insights into the film industry’s dynamics.

---

## ✅ Conclusion

This project provided valuable insights into the movie industry through the lens of data.

Identified financially successful and underperforming films, I recognized the power of franchises, and uncovered trends tied to audience engagement.
